    \section{Introduction}
	Hi. This is a new \LaTeX{} document. I'm using this as a test one.
	
	The point is to familiarize myself with the environment.    
    
	\section{Body}
	I have no idea what to write in here.
	
	I'll be testing math soon enough.
	
	\subsection{Math}
	The well known Pythagorean theorem \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\) was proved to be invalid for other exponents. 	
	Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions: 
	
	\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]   
    
	As such, there are other ways to represent equations. Consider $E = mc^2$, or \begin{math}y = mx + c\end{math}.
	
	Even among the \textit{displayed} modes, there are two variations - \textit{numbered} and \textit{unnumbered}.
	
	Among unnumbered, consider $$v^2 = u^2 + 2at$$ and \[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]    
	
	For numbered equations, look at this method
	\begin{equation}
		v = u + at	
	\end{equation}
